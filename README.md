Coding Challenge - Marvel API - v1

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

This is a 1 hour coding challenge. I've spent stricktly 1 hour on this project to demonstrate what can achieve.

To install, clone the project and

### `yarn install`

Create your .env file

##### `REACT_APP_PUBLICKEY = your_api_key`

##### `REACT_APP_PRIVATEKEY = your_private_key`

To start, in the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`
